# Diagnosis Leaf of plant for Deep Learning Project
We are a data science community that aims to develop the field of plant data analysis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture. We created a website consisting of two categories of users: one is volunteers (botanists, farmers, and data analysts), and the other category is people who benefit from the services provided by volunteers.
We have studied and diagnosed plant diseases through Deep Learning techniques. We have built a model that predicts the state of the leaf of the plant if healthy or contains some kind of diseases such as rust and scab or the paper contains multi diseases. In the future, we will study the specialized agricultural crops in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, such as dates, faqaa, etc., and we will add methods of treating diseases on the site in cooperation with botany experts
